### Hi there 👋🏼

I experienced how hard building a great team and a great product Customers love and want. I witnessed how hard building a category that can really change the world. Without a doubt, this fosters my product & engineering thinking in my daily contributions.

During my recent years, learning how to scale a SaaS Platform, building a great startup, finding awesome people to work and working with big retails in the UK and US were added as indispensable assets to my experience & knowledge. Moreover, I had a chance working at scale and building software for more than 100M monthly active users in meta search, marketplace and travel domains reaching more than 32 markets.

Currently, I'm Software Engineer at AWS working with customers to help them build and use AWS to solve their business problems.
